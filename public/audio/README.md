# Audio Folder

Add voice notes here to make the letters even more personal!

## How to Add Voice Notes:

1. Record voice notes on your phone
2. Convert them to MP3 format
3. Name them: `voice-note-1.mp3`, `voice-note-2.mp3`, etc. (matching letter IDs)
4. Place them in this folder
5. In `/src/data/letters.js`, set `hasVoiceNote: true` for each letter with audio

## Recording Tips:

- Find a quiet place to record
- Speak clearly and naturally
- Keep them short (30 seconds - 2 minutes)
- Say something personal for each letter theme
- Test the audio quality before adding

**Optional:** You can add voice notes to some letters or skip this feature entirely if you prefer text-only letters.
